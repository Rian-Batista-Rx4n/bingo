Recreating a Bingo game, using Flask and Basic FrontEnd

""WORKING""
Now it is possible to view the numbers that come out, and mark if you have that number in your hands


!For now, I have only created the login and registration page, I will start developing the game page!

It is necessary to have a Flask library to start/run main.py.
After starting main.py, just open it in the browser and type the address 127.0.0.1:5000
